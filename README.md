# colorize.css
a simple and easy colors system to remember.
# How does it do?
It makes set colors easy. you need to remember only 16 colors but finally as a result you will have 112 colors, and the surprise is this 16 colors you are  already known them.
# The colors:
Red, Blue, Green, Pink,
 Yellow, Brown, Purple, Indigo,
 Teal ,Orange, Cyan, Magenta,
Beige, Grey, White, and Black.
> Every color has 7 levels so: 7 * 16 = 112.
# e.g.:
* red-3 = lightest.
* red-2 = lighter.
* red-1 = light.
* red    = normal.
* red1 = dark.
* red2 = darker.
* red3 = darkest.
In the file colorize.htm you will be see all classes in one page.
# How you use it?
* For Backgrounds:
&lt;div class="red-3"&gt;items&lt;/div&gt;
* For Texts:
&lt;div class ="txt-red-3"&gt;items&lt;/div&gt;
* For Borders:
&lt;div class ="border-red3"&gt;items&lt;/div&gt;
* Hover:
Add (-hvr) at the end of any class to get the color in hover.
 e.g. (red-3-hvr / txt-green2-hvr / border-blue-hvr ).
